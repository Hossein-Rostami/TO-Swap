# TO-Swap
This code uses the same functions as TOP but uses the SA optimizer to swap the black and white elements. 
I am changing some parameters like minimum temperature, number of iterations, alpha (reduction ratio of temperature), etc. to see the effect of each parameter. 
>>>>> Increasing alpha from 0.85 to 0.97 improves the results regarding shape and final value
